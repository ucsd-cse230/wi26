## Late Policy

You have a total of _four late days_ that you can use throughout the quarter.

- A late day means anything between 1 second and 23
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline
- If you submit past the late day limit, you get 0 points for that assignment
- There is no penalty for submitting late but within the limit

## Github CodeSpaces

We will be using github codespaces for the assignments, so you don't have to do
any local setup. Please make sure you **have a github account** that is linked to the
class.

## Assignments

Fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/MHTgynyHP7W6v8Di9) by **Fri 1/16**
so we can link your github and UCSD IDs. Otherwise **you will get `0`**
for the programming assignments!
