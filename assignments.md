**LATE POLICY:** You have a total of **4** late days that can be used
in atomic units over the entire quarter. By "atomic" I mean, for example,
that 35 mins over the deadline is equal to 1 late day.

## Github CodeSpaces

We will be using github codespaces for all the assignments, so you don't have to do
any local setup. Please make sure you **have a github account** that is linked to the
class.
