## Ownership: Rust's Secret Sauce

Enables memory safety without a garbage collector.

### Garbage Collection (Java, Python, Haskell)

Runtime that looks for and _reclaims_ unused memory

- Memory _safe_ (can only use "valid" memory that has not been freed)
- Adds unpredictable _overhead_

as the program runs; in other languages,

### Manual Management (C, C++)

**Programmer** explicitly `alloc` and `free` memory

- Memory _unsafe_ (bugs let you use invalid memory!)
- _Zero_ runtime overhead

### Ownership (Rust)
