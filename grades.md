Your final grade will be computed as follows.

### Worksheets (20%)

We will have an "in class" worksheetshanded out in each
lecture and which is to be turned in at the end of the lecture.
Turn in 75% of the worksheets to get full credit.
Responses will be graded on participation (not correctness).

### Programming Assignments (20%)

**Four** programming assignments, done individually.
Will be assigned approximately every two weeks,
and instructions on turning them in will be posted with
each assignment. You have a total of _four late days_
that you can use throughout the quarter as you need them,
where a late day means anything between 1 second and 23
hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline.

### Midterm Exams (40%)

There will be **two** closed-book pencil-and-paper midterm exams,
each worth 20% of the grade -- to be held during lecture on
**Th 2/5** and **Tu 3/10** respectively. You may bring a
letter-sized **"notes sheet"** of paper to help you during
the exam (feel free to use both sides, if you wish.)

### Project (20%)

A [project](project.html) that will be completed **in a group of 2-3**
and demo-ed and evaluated during the final exam block on **Thu 03/19 8:00a – 11:00a**.
