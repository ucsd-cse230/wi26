## Description

The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including high-level programming abstractions, expressive
type systems and program analyses. We will develop these ideas as follows.

1. First, we will learn about _functional programming_ in
   [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), a programming language
   that has been the incubator for many recent PL advances.
   We will use Haskell to learn about a variety of
   _high-level programming_ abstractions and techniques.

2. Second, we will learn about how high-level abstractions
   can be combined with modern resource tracking _type systems_
   to enable _safe systems programming_ in the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org)
   programming language, which permits low-level memory
   manipulation, and enables nice concurrency and parallelism
   abstractions, all while ensuring memory and thread safety.

3. Time permitting, we will conclude with an introduction
   to the _formal verification_ of programs, i.e. how to
   specify that code has certain desirable properties, and
   how to automatically verify that those properties are
   indeed satisfied by the implementation.

For more details see the [lecture](lectures.html) plan.

## Prerequisites

The class is mostly self contained. However, it will be _helpful_ to have
some knowledge of basic discrete math, and it will be _essential_
that you enjoy programming and have a desire to learn the material.

## Policies

1. We will not be podcasting lectures.
2. We will have worksheets to be filled in and submitted in every lecture.
3. We have a _no-screens_ policy: students must keep their devices off during lectures.
4. We require all exams be taken on the [announced dates and times](https://ucsd-cse230.github.io/wi26/contact.html)

## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/manual/Appendices/app2.htm).

In particular,

> all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned,
> without unauthorized aid of any kind.

You are expected to do your own work on all assignments; except for the
final group project.

You may (and are encouraged to) engage in **general** discussions with
your classmates regarding the assignments, but specific details of a solution,
including the solution itself, **must always be your own work**.

You may use Copilot/ChatGPT/Claude etc. for your programming assignments,
but do so at your own risk: the midterm(s) and final examinations
will be _heavily_ based on the assignments, and doing well in them
will **require a thorough understanding** of the solutions to the programming
assignments. These exams will be entirely analog: no tools other than
your brain and a writing instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously. In addition to receiving a zero (0) on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University. Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.

## Research

Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor or TA to do so after final grades have been issued.
**This has no impact on your grade in any manner.**
